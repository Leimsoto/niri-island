/* waywallen-bridge — protocol bit constants shared by every renderer

 * These values mirror waywallen/src/negotiate.rs (and the daemon's

 * `mem_hints` / `sync_caps` / `color_caps` fields of
 * `waywallen_producer_capabilities_t` and check them on incoming
 * `waywallen_buffer_directive_t`. The daemon takes the intersection with
 * each consumer's caps to pick a scheme.
 *
 * Keep in sync with negotiate.rs — all bits are part of the wire
